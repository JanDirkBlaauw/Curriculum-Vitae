Hello!
This nearly seems like the perfect job (if I can get it Part-Time its perfect), It is my chance to start, even though I have never studied programming on a School. If the possibility exists for me to work Part-Time with you guys, I would gladly take the offer.
I need structure to work. This application has been developed in less than 2 months, while it mostly was collecting dust because I got side-tracked with other apps I am currently working on.
As for working clean with structure, It always is hard to make a choice which method someone else likes; Compacted, all items of the same category in 1 line, or all spread out. Stacked under categories, or under Item.
While my availability might seem low; Mondays and Tuesdays, I can do much work when I am there. I am someone that likes to have things done.

If I get asked for an UI, I can make multiple designs, Like visible in the app this is Embedded into, or at least I hope it is embedded. Else it will stay on my GitHub and Work Folder.
While I currently only master FrontEnd Development for iOS, I will probably be able to learn BackEnd fast too; I understand nearly any line of code I read.

I hope you are interested enough to take a peek at my app; My resume is inside that. Just as a small taste of my abilities; I have learned everything I demonstrated in less than 8 months.
Sincerely,
    Jan Dirk Blaauw
